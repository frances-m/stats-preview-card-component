- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I'm new to Sass, so it was really helpful to play around with it a bit in this project. I also was reminded about how important it is to plan ahead when it comes to different layouts - oops. CSS Grid was super helpful when it came to switching up the layouts, as well as properly positioning the image overlay with ease.
